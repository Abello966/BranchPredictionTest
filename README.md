# Branch Prediction Test

These two programs are meant to test the existence of Branch Prediction on a processer. It was built for the 2018 realization of the MAC5742 course at IME-USP.

The first program uses GCC builtin expect flags to try to optimize the execution of an insertion sort with the elements in reverse order (i.e all ifs will return true)

The second program tests different if patterns repeated on a for to test dynamic branch prediction.
